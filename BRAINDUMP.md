Popup HTML live , can confirm active tab

1. WOHHHHHHH so the popup is now active and we have even gone so far as to confirm that we can check the active tab
2. Just for testing purposes, I have included an extra <p> in popup.html
3. When the user clicks on either button, the script checks what the active tab is, gets its data, and then plops the title of the tab onto the new <p>
4. This confirms that we can, in fact, check which tab is active
5. Everything else, btw, is turned off, including most of background.js (except the load confirmation and installation confirmation), all of content.js, and also the actual functionalities within the popup.js event listeners
