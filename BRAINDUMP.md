Video IDs and Video Title fetching

1. We can now fetch the video title and ID as needed
2. The challenge was finding the right element to get the data from, ensuring especially that it is present in all video elements
3. The true challenge, however, was creating the correct script to actually fetch the needed data, as I sorta probably forgot how DOM fetching works in JavaScript
  3.1. I've been doing mostly Python DOM fetching so yeah
4. I am able to add video ID and video Title to the corresponding arrays, but I want selectedVideoTitles[] data to be objects, as described in the previous commit
