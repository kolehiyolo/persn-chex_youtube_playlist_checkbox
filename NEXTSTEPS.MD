1. With my understanding of the codebase pretty robust already, the next step is to actually revisit the code and make it all work
2. Right now, Chrome throws some errors about the extension that apparently prevents it from even being used by the user
3. I'll check those, but most importantly, just turn off first some parts of the extension that I know for a fact are just gonna bog down my process
4. First thing is I need to at the very least have the extension be "working" for the user, even if it doesn't actually do the API calls yet
5. My thinking is, at least for now, I want the popup to actually show, then take it from there
